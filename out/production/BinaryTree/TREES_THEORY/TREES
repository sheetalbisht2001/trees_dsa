TREES AND GRAPHS ARE  NON - LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?
The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e.,
they are not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged on multiple levels or
we can say it is a hierarchical structure.

   BASIC TERMINOLOGY OF TREES

   1. ROOT -> TOPMOST NODE (7)
   2. PARENT -> Node which connects to the child (7,8,2,11,3)
   3. CHILD -> Node which is connected by another node is its child (8,2,11,1,0,2,3,4)
   4. LEAF/EXTERNAL NODE -> Nodes with no children
   5. INTERNAL NODE -> NODES WITH ATLEAST ONE CHILD
   6.DEPTH -> No of edges from root to the node.
   7.HEIGHT -> No of edges from node to the deepest leaf.
   8.SIBLING -> Nodes belonging to the same parents
   9. ANCESTORS -> (8,2,11,3,7)
   10.DESCENDANT -> (3,4)
   11.SUBTREE -> (8,2,11)


   THREE TYPES OF TREE DATA STRUCTURES
   1. BINARY TREE :- each node can have max of two children linked to.
   2. TERNARY TREE :- each node can have max of three chid nodes.
   3. N-ary TREE / GENERIC TREE  :- multiple nodes


   TRAVERSAL:-
    PREORDER-TRAVERSAL
    IN ORDER TRAVERSAL
    POST-ORDER TRAVERSAL
